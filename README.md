## Project Overview

In this project, we explore advanced data compression techniques in cell-free communication systems. The focus is on data compression strategies like splitting the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and Least Significant Bit (LSB) to enhance communication efficiency between one data source and two receivers, with recovery performed at a central processing unit (CPU). This approach aims to improve bandwidth utilization and data reliability in modern wireless networks.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Compression**: Uses MSB/LSB splitting techniques to manage data transfer effectively.
- **Multi-terminal Analysis**: Includes multi-terminal system analysis with multiple access points.
- **AI and ML Integration**: Incorporates machine learning models for optimized data handling.
- **Information Theory Insights**: Provides insights into information-theoretic limits in wireless communications.
